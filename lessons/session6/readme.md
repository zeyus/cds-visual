# Session 4 - Image Classification 2 with ```scikit-learn```

## Overview

Today we'll be continuing to work on training machine learning classifiers using ```scikit-learn```.

We'll be working with a new dataset called ```Cifar10```, which features some more complicated categories than the simple handwritten images we saw last week.

The code we're doing today will form the basis of [Assignment 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/KLVvny7d).
