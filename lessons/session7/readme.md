# Session 7 - Introducing ```TensorFlow```

## Overview

In the past few classes, we've been looking at how to build simple classifiers on greyscale image data using ```scikit-learn```. This is really good for benchmarking and providing baselines to build upon. However, something you may have noticed is that ```scikit-learn``` is a bit clunky and can be quite slow during training. This becomes even more pronounced as we start to scale to bigger and bigger datasets.

Today, we'll start to see how we can build more sophisticated machine learning models using the library ```TensorFlow```. In coming weeks, we'll also see that ```TensorFlow``` allows us to build fancy neural networks to work with colour images - so called *convolutional neural networks*.
