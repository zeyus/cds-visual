# Session 9 - Using pretrained CNNs for classification

## Overview

In previous weeks, we've seen how to build classifier models using simple techniques like making images greyscale and flattening them down. We also saw last week how we can use Convolutional Neural Networks to go beyond this and use deep learning methods which make use of the fact that colour images are multidimensional objects.

This week, we'll be seeing how *pretrained CNNS* can be used to create *image embeddings* which can be used as the input layer for classifiers and see how much this improves performance. This process of taking a CNN pretrained on one domain and using it on a different domain is known as *transfer learning*.

We'll also have some time to start on [Assignement 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/Aj7Sf-j_)
